"Hackathon project for Emergency Financial Hotspot for Cashless Transactions"



Our platform integrates a unique feature that can be incorporated into existing digital payment systems like Google Pay and Paytm, enabling secure offline peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. This solution is ideal for emergency situations or areas with limited internet connectivity. By utilizing Bluetooth, NFC, and mesh network technologies, users can carry out financial transactions without requiring an active internet connection. Once reconnected, all transaction data is synchronized with Vultr's cloud infrastructure, ensuring smooth reconciliation.
